/etc/initramfs-tools/modules, adding pwm_lpss_platform, and ran sudo update-initramfs -k all -u.
---

Hello

 

I had very frequently a black screen at boot ( it can appends with liveUSB too) and i figured out that it was just a backlight problem (backlight totaly shut off) . my first not-so-solution was to supend-resume to get the screen back. but still no backlight control.

 

then i found "pwm_lpss_platform"

 

just add "pwm_lpss_platform" in /etc/initramfs-tools/modules

then

# sudo update-initramfs -k all -u
and no more black screen again and moreover the brightness is now controlable.

for information :  Wifi works out of the box since kernel 4.12

For me  SDcard works since kernel 4.15

for Ubuntu, to get a recent kernel :

go to http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/

go to the version you want. download in the same directory

- linux-headers-xxxxx-all.deb
- linux-headers-xxxxxx-generic_xxxxx_amd64.deb
- linux-image-xxxxxx-generic_xxxxx_amd64.deb

then

sudo dpkg -i linux*.deb
as a bonus i give you my GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT from /etc/default/grub :

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="video=DSI-1:800x1280e acpi_osi= i915.modeset=1 fbcon=rotate:1  video.use_native_backlight=1 i915.enable_fbc=1 i915.enable_rc6=1 i915.semaphores=1 nospalsh quiet"

video= and  fbcon=  are clear but i admit i don't really know the effect of the others. 

I hope I help someone with these information.

now...  can anybody help me to get my f***ing Bluetooth working ?

I didn't manage to get it works with https://github.com/lwfinger/rtl8723bs_bt

 

M.V.
